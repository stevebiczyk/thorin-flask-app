<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.</p>

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, he
            and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in
            exile, he
            quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of
            Azanulbizar in
            TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the
            fighting, his
            shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet
            "Oakenshield,"
            which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

        <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and
            younger brother of Óin.

        <h3>Balin</h3>
        <p>
            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother
            named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain.
            Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs
            which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied
            Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was
            captured and lost.[

            younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied

        <h3>Ori</h3>
        <p>
            Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a
            member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other Dwarves on the
            quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other Dwarves of
            Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies, which he survived.

            In TA 2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in

        <h3>Bombur</h3>
        <p>
            Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's
            line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell
            somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some
            fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and
            Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey,
            Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.
